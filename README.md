MMS 142 Group Activity: Disruptive Technologies

No sweat guys, we are not creating a program or developing a new application hahaha
We ain't be coding/programming things here.
We are just going to create a report, and will be using the GitHub Pages(GitHub's website feature)
to present that report.

We are gonna try our best to keep everything in GitHub (like what prof told us to do)
I already created a project board for us.
Check out the project board for things we need to do.
As of now we have two issues I created. First in the "CHOOSE A TOPIC" and "CHOOSE A THEME". Go to
issues for further details.

I messed around with the Wiki section too. If you are interested of what I wrote there then read
my crap hahaha.


See ya around!
